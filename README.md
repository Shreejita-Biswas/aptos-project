Preventive Health Reward Token System
Project Overview
The Preventive Health Reward Token System is a blockchain-based solution built on the Aptos blockchain that incentivizes preventive healthcare activities by rewarding users with tokens. This innovative system aims to improve public health outcomes by encouraging regular health check-ups, screenings, and healthy lifestyle choices.
Project Description
This smart contract implementation creates a decentralized platform where healthcare providers and wellness organizations can reward individuals for taking proactive steps toward maintaining their health. The system tracks completed health activities and distributes cryptocurrency rewards accordingly.
Key Features

User Registration: Simple onboarding process for participants to join the health rewards program
Activity Tracking: Records completed preventive health activities
Token Rewards: Automatically distributes token rewards to users upon verification of completed activities
Transparent Reward History: Maintains a verifiable record of all health activities and rewards

Technical Implementation
The system is implemented as a Move smart contract on the Aptos blockchain, consisting of:

A HealthProfile structure that stores user activity data and reward history
A registration function for new users to join the program
An activity recording function that updates user profiles and distributes token rewards

Project Vision
Our vision is to transform preventive healthcare through positive financial incentives, making healthy choices more appealing and accessible to everyone. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

Increase Preventive Care Participation: Boost rates of regular health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups through direct financial incentives.
Improve Public Health Outcomes: Reduce the prevalence of preventable diseases and lower healthcare costs by encouraging early detection and healthy lifestyle choices.
Create a Sustainable Health Economy: Establish a token ecosystem where health insurers, employers, and healthcare systems can offer meaningful rewards for preventive actions, creating a win-win scenario where both individuals and health systems benefit financially from improved health outcomes.
Ensure Data Privacy: Utilize blockchain's security features to protect sensitive health information while still verifying completed activities.
Scale Globally: Design a solution that can be adapted to various healthcare systems worldwide, making preventive healthcare more accessible in both developed and developing regions.

By rewarding prevention rather than just treating illness, this system represents a paradigm shift in healthcare incentives, aligning financial benefits with positive health behaviors.
Getting Started
To integrate with the Preventive Health Reward Token System, healthcare providers and organizations can deploy the smart contract and interact with its functions to register users and reward health activities.
Future Development
Future iterations of this system may include:

Integration with health tracking wearables for automated activity verification
Expanded reward categories for different types of preventive activities
Governance mechanisms allowing community input on reward structures
Partnerships with health insurance providers for premium discounts
