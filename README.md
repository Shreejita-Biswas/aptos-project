ü©∫ Project Title
Preventive Health Rewards on Aptos Blockchain

üìÑ Project Description
This smart contract module, HealthSystem::PreventiveHealthRewards, is designed to incentivize healthy behavior using blockchain technology. Built on the Aptos blockchain, the system allows users to register, log their health-related activities, and earn token-based rewards (in AptosCoin) provided by registered sponsors or health reward providers.

The module ensures that:

Users can only register once.

Each recorded health activity increases a user's activity count and rewards balance.

Token rewards are securely transferred from the provider‚Äôs account to the user‚Äôs wallet upon activity completion.

This creates a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof method to encourage and track preventive healthcare efforts.

üåç Project Vision
To promote wellness and preventive healthcare at scale by leveraging decentralized infrastructure. The system empowers users to take proactive steps toward better health, while enabling healthcare organizations, insurers, or governments to sponsor rewards with full transparency. Long-term, this aims to reduce healthcare costs and improve overall population health outcomes through incentivized, self-directed care.
